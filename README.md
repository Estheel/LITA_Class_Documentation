## Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard

1. Customer Segmentation Analysis Dashboard Insights

##Key Observations:

#Top Customers by Revenue: Each top customer contributes around 3 million in revenue, indicating a high concentration of revenue from a small number of customers.

#Churn Rate: The churn rate is 0.45, suggesting that around 45% of customers are not continuing with their subscriptions, which is high and may need improvement.

#Total Revenue: The total revenue stands at 68 million.

#Revenue by Region: Revenue is relatively evenly distributed across regions, with each region contributing roughly 25% of the total.

#Subscription Segmentation by Region: The Basic subscription is the most popular, with nearly double the numbers of Standard and Premium subscriptions. The North and East regions have higher customer counts for Basic subscriptions, while Premium and Standard are less common.

#Customer Cancellation: The data table indicates that there is a mix of cancellations across regions and subscription types, with Basic in the North region showing some cancellations.


##Actionable Insights and Recommendations:

1. Reduce Churn Rate:
Investigate reasons for the high churn rate (0.45) through customer feedback, surveys, or direct engagement.
Consider loyalty programs, discounts, or personalized offers to encourage customer retention, especially targeting regions with higher cancellations.

2. Upsell Opportunities for Premium Subscriptions:
Since Basic subscriptions dominate, there may be an opportunity to upsell to Standard or Premium.
Target marketing efforts in the North and East regions to promote the benefits of upgrading to higher subscription tiers.

3. Customer Retention in the North Region:
Since there are some cancellations in the North, focus on retention strategies, such as personalized engagement, to reduce cancellations.
Conduct surveys or feedback sessions specifically for North customers to understand why cancellations are occurring.

4. Optimize Regional Marketing Strategies:
With revenue fairly balanced across regions, tailor regional marketing campaigns to strengthen customer engagement, particularly for high-revenue customers.
Consider region-specific promotions or incentives to boost customer satisfaction and retention.

2. Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard Insights

Key Observations:

Total Quantity Sold and Sales Revenue: 9,921 units sold, with total sales reaching 21 billion, indicating high average revenue per unit.

Monthly Sales Trends: Sales remain relatively stable from January to July but see a significant drop in August, suggesting a potential seasonal impact or a one-time event.

Top Products by Revenue: Hats and Shoes are the top revenue generators, followed by Jackets, Shirts, Gloves, and Socks.

Top Selling Product by Quantity: Hats have the highest quantity sold, followed by Shoes and Jackets.

Sales Contribution by Region: Sales contributions are evenly distributed across the East, North, South, and West regions, each contributing around 25% of the sales.


Actionable Insights and Recommendations:

1. Investigate the Drop in August Sales:

Examine potential causes for the decline in August sales, such as seasonal demand fluctuations, supply chain issues, or ineffective promotions.

Implement targeted marketing campaigns or promotional events to boost sales during August if this trend is consistent year over year.



2. Product Promotion for High-Performing Items:

Since Hats and Shoes generate the most revenue, increase the visibility of these products through promotions, ads, or bundling with lower-performing items like Gloves or Socks.

Consider expanding the product lines for Hats and Shoes, as they appear to be popular and contribute significantly to revenue.



3. Balance Inventory and Stock Based on Product Demand:

Ensure adequate stock levels of high-demand products like Hats and Shoes to avoid stockouts.

Monitor and adjust inventory for lower-demand products like Socks, possibly running promotions to clear stock and improve overall inventory turnover.



4. Regional Sales Strategy:

With balanced sales contributions across regions, maintain consistent product availability across regions.

Tailor marketing strategies regionally by promoting popular items based on regional preferences observed, as each region contributes equally to total sales.



5. Boost Sales in Low-Quantity Products through Bundling:

Consider bundling low-quantity products like Gloves and Socks with high-performing items, which can increase overall product sales and reduce excess inventory.
